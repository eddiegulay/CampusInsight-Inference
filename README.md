# Flask Rest

## Overview

Flask-Rest is a lightweight and flexible REST API project built using the Flask web framework. It provides a solid foundation for developing RESTful web services, making it easy to create, update, and retrieve data through HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:** The project is organized into modular components such as routes, models, and views, promoting maintainability and scalability.

- **Configurability:** Configuration settings are stored in separate files, with sensitive information placed in an instance folder, enhancing security and flexibility.

## Getting Started

To run the Flask-Rest project:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
3. Run config.bat or config.sh to set the environment variables.
4. Run the app with `flask run`.
5. Or just run python run.py

## Usage

This is a template repository, so you can use it as a starting point for your own projects. You can modify the project structure, add new features, and customize the code to suit your needs.
clone the repository and start building your own RESTful web services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aida-LLC/Flask-Rest.git
cd flask-rest
pip install -r requirements.txt
